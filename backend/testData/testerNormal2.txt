Subject: Team Lunch Reminder

Dear Team,

Just a friendly reminder about our team lunch scheduled for this Friday at 12:30 PM. We'll be going to the Italian restaurant around the corner that we talked about during our last meeting. It's a great opportunity for us all to relax and enjoy some time together outside of the office.

Please let me know by Wednesday if you will be able to make it, so I can confirm our reservation.

Looking forward to a great lunch with everyone!

Best,
[Ross]
